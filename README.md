# Microsoft Stock Price Analysis

This project presents a simple financial analysis of Microsoft (MSFT) stock prices using moving averages.  
The goal is to demonstrate how 20-day and 50-day moving averages can be used to identify trends in stock price data.  
The project is beginner-friendly and implemented in Python using commonly used data science libraries.

## Project Overview

 Load historical MSFT stock data from a CSV file
 Calculate 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages
 Visualize closing prices along with moving averages using matplotlib

## Visualization

The plot below shows Microsoft’s stock closing prices with overlaid 20-day and 50-day moving averages:
